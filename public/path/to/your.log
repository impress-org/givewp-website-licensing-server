Previously a small set of Tributes fields were available for export and NO fields were available to select during import. We have added the missing Tributes fields to the donations export screen and also made those fields selectable in the donation import screen.</li> </ul> <h4> 1.5.2: December 6th, 2018 </h4> <ul> <li>Fix: Utilize only AJAX validation rather than HTML5 based validation methods for hidden fields. This resolves a browser limitation issue for hidden fields attempting to be validated when the donor has not chosen the option.</li> </ul> <h4> 1.5.1: November 28th, 2018 </h4> <ul> <li>Tweak: The donor's full name is now displayed in the {tribute_info} tag rather than just the first name.</li> <li>Fix: Ensure the required asterisk on honoree email appears when floating are labels applied to the donation form.</li> <li>Fix: Ensure capitalization isn't stripped from the Tributes Options text in the eCard email message text.</li> <li>Fix: The Tributes email field now properly validates that the email input is properly formatted.</li> </ul> <h4> 1.5.0: July 10th, 2018 </h4> <ul> <li>New: Added support for Tribute exports to the Give Core CSV exporter.</li> <li>New: Added multiple message support to notices within wp-admin.</li> <li>New: The tribute options text is now sortable in Tributes settings section within wp-admin.</li> <li>New: Added bulk options to the Tributes list table in wp-admin.</li> <li>Tweak: Removed the &quot;#&quot; from the tributes' donation list to match other list screens in wp-admin.</li> <li>Tweak: If the plugin's minimum requirements are not met the plugin will no longer deactivate but rather be active but not able to be used until requirements are met.</li> <li>Fix: Required fields within the Tributes section can now be programatically set to not required.</li> <li>Fix: When a donor gave multiple times the name that was originally associated with the donor's email address was the one that is passed to the {donor_fullname} template tag regardless if a different name was submitted with the donation.</li> </ul> <h4> 1.4.2: May 2nd, 2018 </h4> <ul> <li>Tweak: Updated deprecated actions in Give Core 2.1+ - please update Give Core to the latest version!</li> </ul> <h4> 1.4.1: February 15th, 2018 </h4> <ul> <li>New: The plugin is now integrated with Manual Donations so you can easily record and send out dedication emails and eCards manually!</li> <li>Fix: Tributes ecard not sending properly for PayPal Standard transaction.</li> </ul> <h4> 1.4: January 31st, 2018 </h4> <ul> <li>New: Refactored code base to follow directory and file structuring of other Give add-ons.</li> <li>New: Revamped the UI for adding tribute types within the global settings screen.</li> <li>Fix: Tribute notification email sent to admin when a new donation added using the Manual Donations add-on.</li> <li>Fix: Resolved incorrect output of the {tribute_info} email tag.</li> <li>Fix: Removed the first &quot;delete&quot; option from the UI when multi-recipients are enabled for eCard.

That's been fixed so now you can customize Tributes per form.</li> </ul> <h4> 1.3.5: January 17th, 2018 </h4> <ul> <li>Tweak: 2.0 is now minimum version requirement to run this add-on.</li> <li>Fix: Tributes eCards were not sending properly for offsite gateways such as PayPal Standard.</li> </ul> <h4> 1.3.4: January 9th, 2018 </h4> <ul> <li>Tweak: Added some minor UI improvements to wp-admin.</li> <li>Tweak: Removed unecessary code for checking PHP version since Give core now handles that environment check.</li> <li>Tweak: Minor updates for the upcoming Give 2.0 release.</li> <li>Tweak: The {amount} email tag used in the Tributes add-on now excludes the fee amount. This is a compatibility fix with the fee recovery add-on.</li> <li>Fix: Preventing timeouts from happening when attempting to preview a PDF Mail a Card without having set a card graphic. The placeholder graphic would not load causing the error.</li> <li>Fix: There was a bug preventing &quot;Mail a Card&quot; recipient's last names to not get saved to the database properly.</li> <li>Fix: The email subject column would appear empty if the settings were never saved.

This will give your donors more flexibility with their dedications should they prefer to send eCards to more than on person.</li> <li>New: Admins can now have the ability to control the &quot;Notify the honoree&quot; option. This means you can now control the donor's options for notifying the recipient of their tribute donation. The &quot;Donor Chooses Method&quot; (default): This option will allow the donor to choose how he/she wants the recipient to be notified (most common). The &quot;Admin Chooses Method&quot;: The admin (you) can choose the specific notification method &quot;Mail a Card&quot; or &quot;eCard&quot; without allowing the donor to choose. No Notification: Choose this option if the you don't want to provide the donor an option to notify the recipient (this is useful if you plan on handling notifications on your own).</li> <li>New: Added the {send_tribute_info} email tag for admin notification email purposes.</li> <li>Fix: AJAX optimizations made for higher traffic sites.</li> <li>Fix: Improved support for the &quot;Reveal&quot; display method.</li> <li>Fix: When the a donation form is embedded on a post or page the Dedication options for the last form would not appear correctly.</li> <li>Fix: Per form customized eCards would not send the subject line properly to notification recipients.</li> <li>Fix: The dedication field now does not appear above the recurrion options for a donation form.</li> <li>Fix: Certain currency characters were having display issues within the Mail a Card PDF output and would appear as &quot;?&quot; rather than the correct symbol.</li> </ul> <h4> 1.1: September 5th, 2017 </h4> <ul> <li>New: Added additional section for the dedication notification to specify a separate first and last name apart from the tributee to account for cases such as &quot;In memory of&quot; where the person being dedicated may be deceased and the notifier is a separate party.</li> <li>New: Added a new option to hide the prepended label in the backend.</li> <li>New: Added &quot;Dedication&quot; items to the donation receipt table.</li> <li>Tweak: Certain fields like the raw eCard and Mail card content are no longer saved to the payment meta and rather now created dynamically based off the current settings.</li> <li>Tweak: Improved various tag's output like the donor's first and last names.</li> <li>Tweak: Heavily optimized and refactored the codebase.</li> <li>Tweak: Updated CSS to ensure no bullet points or margins are inappropriately applied to Tributes lists with some themes'.</li> <li>Fix: Updated JS to ensure no deprecated methods are in use.</li> </ul> <h4> 1.0.0 </h4> <ul> <li>Initial plugin release.

Much faster fee calculations and a better donor experience.</li> <li>Fix: When changing payment gateways in modal display mode the fee recovery checkbox field would incorrectly appear at the top of the modal.

Now the {amount} template tag will display a breakdown of the fees collected compared to the actual donation automatically to better inform your donors.</li> <li>Fix: Math for the fee calculation was slightly off. Thanks @Benunc for jumping on it with your math wizardry.</li> <li>Fix: The plugin will deactivate itself if Give core is deactivated.</li> <li>Fix: Admins couldn't update the fee amount within wp-admin for individual payments. Now they can.</li> <li>Fix: Fees were counting towards goals and reflected in income reports. Now we exclude the fee amount from goals and reports so you can see the original donation total.</li> </ul> <h4> 1.0 </h4> <ul> <li>Initial plugin release.
